# Cookiecutter Template For BackMarket Data Science Projects
**Helping to promote an uniform data analysis and rules**

*Cookiecutter is a command-line utility that automatically scaffolds new projects for you based on a template (referred to as cookiecutters):* 

*http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readme.html*


This cookiecutter is used in conjunction with a base development image available in [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/manifoldai/docker-ml-dev/) to provide an out-of-the-box ready environment for many Data Science and Machine Learning project use cases.
After running this cookiecutter and the provided start script a developer will have a local development setup that looks like this: 

![docker local dev](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/manifold-public-no-vpn/torus_local_dev.png)

By scaffolding your data science projects using this cookiecutter you will get:

- Project Docker image built with your own Dockerfile for project specific requirements
- Docker Compose configuration that dynamically binds to a free host port and forwards to the jupyter server listening port inside the container
- Shared volume configuration for accessing and executing all your project code inside of the controlled container environment
- Ability to edit code using your favorite IDE on your host machine and seeing real-time changes to the runtime environment
- Jupyter notebook fully configured with nb-extensions ready for development and feature engineering
- Common data science and plotting libraries pre-installed in the container environment to start working immediately

There are several downstream benefits for moving to a container-first workflow in terms of model and inference engine deployment/delivery.
By using containers early in the development cycle you can remove a lot of the configuration management issues that waste developer time and ultimately lower quality of deliverables.

## Getting Started
1. Install Docker: 
    - For Mac: https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac
    - For Windows: https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows
    - For Linux: Go to this page and choose the appropriate install for your Linux distro: https://www.docker.com/community-edition
        - Install Docker Compose (https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose):
            ```bash
            $ sudo curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.21.0/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
            ```
            ```bash
            $ sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
            ```
            Test the installation:
            ```bash
            $ docker-compose --version
            docker-compose version 1.21.0, build 1719ceb
            ```
2. Install Python Cookiecutter package: http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html >= 1.4.0
    ``` bash
    $ pip install cookiecutter
    ```
    It is recommended to set up a central virtualenv or condaenv for cookiecutter and any other "system" wide Python packages you may need.
3. Run the cookiecutter docker data science template to scaffold your new project:
    ``` bash
    $ cookiecutter https://github.com/manifoldai/docker-cookiecutter-data-science.git
    ```
4. Answer all of the cookiecutter prompts for project name, description, license, etc.
5. Run the start script from the level of your new project directory:
    ``` bash
    $ ./start.sh
    ```
6. After the project image builds check which host port is being forwarded to the Jupyter notebook server inside the running container:
    ``` bash
    $ docker ps 
    ```
7. Using any browser access your notebook at localhost:{port}
8. Start working!

For more details on what packages are available pre-installed in the base image see the manifoldai/docker-ml-dev repository page on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/manifoldai/docker-ml-dev/).
