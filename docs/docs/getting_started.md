## Getting started

With this in mind, we've created a data science cookiecutter template for projects in Python. Your analysis doesn't have to be in Python, but the template does provide some Python boilerplate that you'd want to remove (in the `src` folder for example, and the Sphinx documentation skeleton in `docs`).

### Requirements

 - Python 2.7 or 3.5
 - [cookiecutter Python package](http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html) >= 1.4.0: `pip install cookiecutter`


### Starting a new project

Starting a new project is as easy as running this command at the command line. No need to create a directory first, the cookiecutter will do it for you.
